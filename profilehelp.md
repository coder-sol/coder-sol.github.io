Alrighty! 

First, let me go through some of the most used html tags:

**IMAGES**

```
<img src="https://example.com/filename.png"/>
```

If you want to put an image on the site just use the img-tag. Easy as that ;)

**Links**
```
<a href="https://example.com/mylink.html"> What the page says </a>
```
If we click the _What the page says_ link we will be taken to https://example.com/mylink.html 

**Sections**
There are a few ways to define a section of the page:

```
<div>...</div>
<span>...</span>
``` 
both of these will give you "invisible" boxes to put stuff in where you want it.

```
<br/> is a line break
<p/> is a new paragraph (often 2 line breaks)
```
